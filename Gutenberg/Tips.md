You have the option to add two types of components in React.
1. Functional component - if you are not using any state. This component only uses props to output the data.
2. Class component - if you are using state inside your component. Then you can extend native React component in your class and use state inside. Generally used if you have API data fetching.

## Attributes
Attributes can have five different types:
- TYPE_STRING
- TYPE_NUMBER
- TYPE_BOOL
- TYPE_ARRAY
- TYPE_OBJECT
